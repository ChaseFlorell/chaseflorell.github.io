Chase is a contract software developer in Enderby British Columbia. He's currently working at [PepsiCo](https://www.pepsico.com/) building mobile apps using Xamarin. Before that, Chase spent two years with [FortisAlberta](https://fortisalberta.com) building a customer facing mobile app for power outages.

When chase isn't doing fulltime Mobile Development, he can be found at home on the farm working on [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) applications, or just chilling with his kids. Chase is an avid fan of camping, so in the *limited* summer months, he can often be found out with his family at one of the free campgrounds in and around the area, or out for a cruise on his motorcycle.
