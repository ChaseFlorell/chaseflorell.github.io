Chase is a software developer in Calgary Alberta. He's currently working at [TransCanada Pipelines](http://transcanada.com) doing DevOps for a number of large projects.

When chase isn't doing fulltime DevOps, he can be found at home working on [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) applications, or just chilling with his kids. Chase is an avid fan of camping, so in the *limited* summer months, he can often be found out with his family at one of the free campgrounds in and around Calgary.
